This is your internal Vercel resume. You should create this during your first week while onboarding.

## Getting Started

### GitHub Setup

You'll need a GitHub account and it will needs to be connected with our Vercel org account - that should have been taken care of already, but if not reach out on Slack in the #it channel and share your GitHub username.

### Create a repository

- Visit https://github.com/vercel/vercel-resume
- Create your repository - click the big green button on the page that says `Use this template`
- Ensure that the "Owner" select field is set to `vercel` (should be already)
- For "Respository name" field use `vercel-resume-${YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}` (e.g. `vercel-resume-elsigh`)
- Make sure the permission level is set to `Internal`
- Click `Create repository from template`

### Import and deploy to Vercel

- Visit https://vercel.com/new
- Click `Import` for your newly created repository.
  - Note: Your repository should be the first item in the list but search if necessary.
- Click `Deploy` on the subsequent screen and enjoy the confetti!
- Click `Go to Dashboard`

## Make it your own

- Click the animating `Collaborate Live` button which will open your project using "Next.js Live"
  - Note: You may need to authenticate again on the subsequent page.
- Click the "<> Code" button in the floating toolbar.
- Edit and share the link as part of your Slack welcome message!
